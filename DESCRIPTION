Description: Creates a Gaussian process model using the specified package. 
    Makes it easy to try different packages in same code, only the
    package argument needs to be changed.
    It is essentially a wrapper for the other Gaussian process
    software packages.
    For more info about Gaussian process software and comparison of various
    options, see Erickson et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2017.10.002>.
