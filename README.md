IGP: Interchangeable Gaussian Processes
=======================================

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CollinErickson/UGP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CollinErickson/UGP) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/IGP)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=IGP)

This is an R package that provides a single interface for many different Gaussian process modeling software options.

This package was formerly called UGP, for Universal Gaussian processes, but universal has a different meaning in kriging so the name was changed for clarity.
