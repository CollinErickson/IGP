I had my submission rejected on 9/14/17 because of copyright issues.
This package includes code copied from two MATLAB toolboxes, DACE and GPML.
I added the authors of each of these as authors of this package with ctb and cph roles.

I added an AUTHORS file that explains that they were the others of their code,
and I am the author of all of the rest of the code.

I added a COPYRIGHTS file that includes the copyright file from GPML,
which clearly states that the code can be included in other projects
with proper attribution and copyright.
See http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/Copyright.
DACE did not have a license or copyright, but is freely available online.
Their site (http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/projects/dace/) mentions that their code 
shouldn't be included in commercial software without written agreement.
I think I'm okay to use it since this is non-commercial.

I did not get consent from either. It is clear that I am okay with GPML,
it is less clear to me with DACE. There is no longer any contact information
on their website. The paper they wrote about it had an email for Hans,
but I emailed it and I got an "Address not found" error email back.
I could not find an email address for Jacob.
I found what I think is an email address for Soren from a different publication,
but I also got an automatic response that that account doesn't exist.

Please let me know if there are any problems with this
and what I should do to resolve it. Thanks!
