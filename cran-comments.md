I had my submission rejected on 9/16/17 (and previously on 9/14/17) because of copyright issues.

This package includes code copied from the MATLAB toolboxes GPML. I added the authors of GPML as authors of this package with ctb and cph roles. I have an AUTHORS file that explains that they were the others of their code, and I am the author of all of the rest of the code.

In my COPYRIGHTS file I copied the copyright file from GPML, which clearly states that the code can be included in other projects as long as their copyright remains. See http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/Copyright.

My previous submission included code from the MATLAB toolbox DACE, but I removed it because of copyright issues.
