I had my submission rejected on 9/18/17 (and previously on 9/16 and 9/14) because of copyright issues.

I removed all the code from other projects that had copyrights. I didn't realize there were many different copyrights inside of the GPML folder since their copyright only mentioned the two authors. I may add it back for a later version, but for now it isn't worth the hassle since it is nonessential code.

All the code here now is my own.

Sorry for the issues with my previous submissions. Thanks for the work you do for CRAN.
